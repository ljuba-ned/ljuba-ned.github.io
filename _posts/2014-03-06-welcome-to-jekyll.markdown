You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

It is stupid that two blocks of code, one below the other, are not separated even if you put few empty lines between them.
  
{% highlight python %}
def hello(name='World'):
    print 'Hello ' + name + '!'

hello()
# => prints Hello World!
hello('Avdija')
# => prints Hello Avdija!
{% endhighlight %}
